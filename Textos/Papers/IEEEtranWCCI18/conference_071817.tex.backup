\section{Introduction}
Deblurring is the task of estimating a sharp latent image,
given a blurry image as input.
% Recovering the original image
% is possible if the details of the blurring method are known, but
% in most cases, blurry images lack of enough information
% to recover a unique image \cite{}. 
It is not observable in the literature
an algorithm for deblurring all objects. Thus, methods that exploit
domain-specific knowledge have emerged for deblurring
categories of objects, e.g., text, faces and motion images \cite{Grigorios2017}.
In oil exploration field, the seismic data acquisition and its
inversion to acoustic impedance attribute typically generates
blurry images of the subsurface, in such a way that it is not
clearly observe the interfaces between different rock layers,
geological structures such as channels, etc.
Obtaining high resolution acoustic impedance images, through seismic inversion methods,
is a critical part in oil reservoir characterization.
Despite the notorious efficiency of the inversion methods,
post-inversion images deblurring has not received much attention.

%O GAP
Reservoir characterization aims to determine a multidimensional
structure and properties of an oil field. To achieve this goal, it is essential to combine, through an
inversion algorithm, the informations, knowledges and available data about the field,
in such a way that it is possible to make the
quantitative predictions about the reservoir behavior \cite{buiting}.
%One of the data used in this process is the seismic amplitude.
The seismic data is widely used in inversion processes because of its facility and precision
in interpreting the acoustic impedance property.
To succeed in seismic inversion, it is necessary to include strategies to deal with multiple
sources of uncertainties. Specifically, the limited band-width of the seismic data leads to
a misinterpretation of the resulting acoustic impedance models.
According to \cite{xiaoiu}, improving the resolution of seismic inversion is
possible by adding high frequency in acquisition and processing seismic data.
However, the earth attenuation, high-frequency noise and other sources, cause
the lack of high and low frequencies in seismic data. 
Thus, deblurring the acoustic impedance models, as a post-inversion refinement process, should lead to a more accurate
interpretation of the impedance models.

We approach  the acoustic impedance deblurring through
a CNN model. CNN is a framework of deep learning which has been
used in a wide sort of machine learning tasks. The availability of benchmarks
\cite{Russakovsky} and the advances in Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) \cite{Buduma15}
allowed CNN to outperform state-of-the-art techniques in detection \cite{Girshick,Bell}, model-free
tracking \cite{Nam}, classification \cite{He2016}. With excellence in feature learning,
CNN achieved notorious success in image and video classification \cite{Krizhevsky2012, AbdelHamid2014}, action  and speech recognition \cite{Farfade2015, S_Ji2013}.
Under the perspective of the reservoir characterization, CNN has been applied to lithofacies recognition
\cite{Qian} and calculation \cite{Liu2017}. However, there is a lack of researches on improving the resolution of
images resulting from inversion processes.

%A solução
In this paper, we propose a new multilayer convolution network model to perform deblurring in post-inversion acoustic impedance.
Each network layer maps higher level features originated in the previews layers through convolutional blur kernels.
To perform this mapping, the kernels, also named weights, are adjusted by minimizing a loss function. 
The model enhances the resolution of acoustic impedance images, resulting in sharp images with
increased high-frequency band-width and lower noise. 
In order to train the model, we blur a set of the synthetic acoustic impedance images to create a dictionary of
images of high and low resolution. Then, the pairs of blur and latent images are normalized and 
presented to the network as input and target, respectively.
%We compare the deblurred images depicted by our model and by two other deblurring methods ().
The core concept of our architecture is the combination of the convolution layers with regression
layers, thus the convolutional layers learn the spatial structures existing in different
acoustic impedance images, while the regression layer proceed the prediction of the property values.

\section{Theoretical Foundations and Related Works}
Inversion theory is used in several areas to infer parameters values
related to physical processes based on experimental data.
Inversion modeling refers to using the current measurements of observable
physical parameters in order to infer the current model parameters (not observable).
The inversion problem is described as (Eq. \ref{eq:deqgm})
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:deqgm}
m = F^{-1}(d)
\end{equation}
where, $F$ is the investigated physical system, and relates a set of model parameters
$m=(m_1, m_2,...,m_n)\subset R^n$ estimated through the observed data $d \in R^s$.
Geophysical methods frequently involve the solution and assessment of inversion problems.
Studying these problems allow inferring physical properties distributions in the earth subsurface, using measured
data. Among these data, the seismic data is mainly used in seismic inversion, which plays an important role in
reservoir characterization. From a practical perspective, solving seismic inversion problems improves
the exploration and management in oil industry, once the seismic data is highly correlated to petrophysical
properties, e.g., density and porosity in subsurface.

The offshore seismic data is the main observable data used in seismic inversion. To perform seismic acquisition,
one sends pulses through a controlled artificial source and captures
the vertical component responses in function of time. The seismic data is a composition of
the wave pulse used in the acquisition, named wavelet, and the characteristic of the interfaces between rock layers,
on which the wavelet reflects. This rock layer characteristic is called reflectivity coefficient and it is
calculated as
\begin{equation}
r(t) = \frac{z(t+\delta t)-z(t)}{z(t+\delta t)+z(t)},
\label{eq:refletv}
\end{equation}
where, $z(t)$ is the acoustic impedance, in function of time $t$, defined as 
$z(t)=\rho(t)v(t)$, where $\rho(t)$ is the rock density and $v(t)$ the propagation velocity
of acoustic wave.
Therefore, the seismic data  $d(t)$ is modeled as a discrete convolution operation $*$ of the wavelet $s$ with the
reflectivity coefficient $r$ as
\begin{equation}
d(t) = s(\tau) * \sum_{j-1}^{N}{r(t- t_j) \delta(t - t_j) + e_d(t)}
\end{equation}
where, $N$ is the number of subsurface layers, $e_d(t)$ is a random noise in function of time.
One ideal wavelet is a delta pulse with all the frequency band-width, however, in practice
wavelets have their band-width generally limited from $6Hz$ to $65Hz$. By consequence,
the images resulting from the seismic inversion will keep their frequency spectrum limited.

According to \cite{Latimer2017}, a good acoustic impedance model contains more information
than the seismic data, because the inversion process contains additional information originated from well-logs, for
exemple, a low-frequency model.
The well-logs are real data measured in wells spread along the field.
With the local acoustic impedance it is possible to calculate the low-frequency
model by interpolation between wells \cite{Buland2003,Figueiredo2012}. Despite of the
low-frequency model, the final model for acoustic impedance still lacks of high resolution details.

Deblurring is generally modeled as the convolution of a blur kernel $k$
with a latent image $I$: 
\begin{equation}
 y = k \otimes I + n
 \label{eq:deblurr}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the noise. Since $k$, $I$ and $n$ are unknown, the problem 
is highly ill-posed and admits infinity solutions for $k$ and $I$.
Several works have developed different deblurring methods for specific purposes.
Blind deconvolution methods are widely investigated in image processing \cite{Bishop2007}.
For the last six years, considerable effort has been employed in single image
\cite{Babacan2012,Krishnan2015,Levin2011,Zhang2011} and multi-image \cite{sroubek2012,Zhu2012} blind deconvolutions. 
Applying blind deconvolution generally implies in making assumptions on
blur kernels and/or on latent images. For example, assuming sparsity of blur kernel
or that natural images have super-Gaussian statistics. The second assumption
leads to the use of image priors on inference process and, consequently, to the maximum \textit{a posteriori}
(MAP) estimation \cite{Babacan2012}. However, \cite{Levin} show that deblurring methods
based on this prior tend to favor blurry images over original latent images.
%,specially for algorithms formulated within the MAP framework.

The Bayesian inference approach \cite{Levin} outperforms the MAP based methods. It marginalizes
the image from the optimization step, while estimating the unknown blur.
The authors show that it is possible to define a class of prior image
based on natural image statistics, suitable enough to represent sharp images features.
This prior formulation makes possible to use Bayesian inference in the estimation of the
unknown image and the blur kernel. According to \cite{Hacohen13}, defining a gradient
prior, by itself, is not sufficient to reach a sharp image, instead,
they search in a dataset for a prior that densely correspond to
the blurry image similar to a sharp image. This search is an
iteratively optimization over the correspondence between the images, the kernel and
the sharp image estimation. Although \cite{Pan2014} suggest a generalization
for the method proposed by \cite{Hacohen13}, it still requires a similar reference image,
which is not always available.

The optimization methods previously described use a set of priors based on
generic image statistics or domain-specific priors. It has been demonstrated
that these methods work properly on synthetic blurs. However, newly studies show that they failure
when applied to real world blurry images \cite{Lai2016} and take a severe computational cost \cite{Chakrabarti2016}.
In contrast, the learning-based methods have gained attention with the resumption and recent advances in neural
networks. The adequate hyper-parameter adjustment allows neural network to learn
non-linear function or blur kernels. Thus, deblurring becomes a function of a blurry image $I$
and a set of parameters $p$ as
\begin{equation}
 y = \sigma(I,p)
 \label{eq:deblur}
\end{equation}
Learning-based methods focus on developing a model to learn the function $\sigma$ \cite{Hradis2015}
and to perform non-blind deblurring \cite{Chakrabarti2016}. \cite{Sun2015} learn a convolution neural networks (CNN) to
recognize motion kernels and performs non-blind deconvolution in
dense motion field estimate, in addition, \cite{Hradis2015} minimize regularized $l_2$ 
in order to perform text deblurring.



\section{Ease of Use}

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
Please do not revise any of the current designations.

\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Table Type Styles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
\cline{2-4} 
\textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\
\hline
copy& More table copy$^{\mathrm{a}}$& &  \\
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{l}{$^{\mathrm{a}}$Sample of a Table footnote.}
\end{tabular}
\label{tab1}
\end{center}
\end{table}



Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
